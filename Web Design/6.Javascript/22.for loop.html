    Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. They are handy in cases in which you want to run the same code repeatedly, adding a different walue each time.
    for(statement1; statement2; statement3){

    }

    Statement 1 is executed before the loop (the code block) starts.
Statement 2 defines the condition for running the loop (the code block).
Statement 3 is executed each time after the loop (the code block) has been executed.
